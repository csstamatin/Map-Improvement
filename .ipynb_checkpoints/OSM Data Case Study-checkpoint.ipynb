    "To start analyzing the data, files from the lesson like mapfix.py, iterrtags.py, and data.py, were used, adding code as needed for this specific set. Overall I found Tallahasse to be a fairly clean map. Many problems were addressed with the provided code including basic address abreviations. \n",

    "The provided sampleosm.py file helped get the sample size down small enough to browse through. The first step was to output information to the console to get a sense of the data. The ittertags.py file helped accomplish this. This was modified to not only output the amount of problem characters, etc., but also to print out a few to help narrow down what needed to be fixed. It was noted that the chosen data was fairly clean. To find problems easier a test database was used. Then data.py was modified to fix the first set of problems, and create the csv's for the test.db. The only change needed was to split any keys that were combined with the type such as key&colon;key&colon;type and label them correctly. This was easy to locate and correct so it was the first priority.\n",

    "It was very interesting and informative to look through Tallahassees OpenStreetMaps data. A large part of the Tallahassee data was clean and needed very few corrections. With a little more time and patience someone could easily fix all the errors. More detail from someone with the time to geo check the data and Tallahassee on OpenStreetMaps should provide the best results. In my opinion, at some point the effort involved to thoroughly clean and catalog all the data would outweigh the benefit of doing so. Sites like OpenStreetMaps that have less resources, I assume, or are open source, rely heavily on community driven solutions. This can cut spending considerably, but creates data that is less ordered and less reliable. Sites like Google Maps that are profit driven rely on skilled employees, tech and logistics to provide a much more complete and reliable map set. They do this by using vast resources and limiting direct community involvement. Both solutions have their benefits and limitations, but they’re just two of the many possible ways to handle map data."
