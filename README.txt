itterrtags.py
This was originally iterrtags.py from the lesson. It was changed to search though an OSM file for tags that could be corrected. Problem characters and correctly spelled values were handled with regular expressions. The other category was a catch all to find words missed or values needing correction. Each tags attribute, first key, type, then value, was assessed, tallied and then added to a list. At the bottom I have commented out lines that print out bits of each list to the console when needed.

data.py
This was originally data.py from the lesson. It was modified to correct additional areas prior to outputting the data into CSV files for a database. Once the corrections were made the files were checked for accuracy and data.py adjusted.
